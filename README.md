# One Last Look At The Sun

One Last Look At The Sun is a 3D first person action game where the player must descend down a procedurally generated pit that becomes progressively harder as you descend. On reaching a certain depth you complete the game.
This project was created for the disseration of my Computer Science Bsc.
